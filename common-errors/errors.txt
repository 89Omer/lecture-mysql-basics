#Cannot add or update a foreign key constraint

When encountering the error "Cannot add or update a foreign key constraint," it generally means there's an issue with the foreign key references. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as:

The referenced table or column does not exist.
The data types of the foreign key and the referenced key do not match.
There's existing data in the child table that violates the foreign key constraint.
To troubleshoot and fix this issue, follow these steps:

Ensure Referenced Tables and Columns Exist: Make sure that all the referenced tables and columns exist and are correctly spelled.

Match Data Types: Verify that the data types of the foreign key columns match the data types of the referenced columns.

Check Existing Data: Ensure there is no existing data in the child table that would violate the foreign key constraint.
